            <span class="normal-part">Equal Work, Unequal Pay</span>
        </p>

        <p class="section-text">
            The gender pay gap is the average difference in earnings between men and women in the workforce.
            It reflects not just differences in pay for the same job, but also unequal access to higher-paying roles,
            promotions, and career opportunities, often driven by discrimination, occupational segregation,
            and social expectations.
        </p>

        <!-- CAUSES -->
        <p class="section1-Causes">Causes</p>

        <h3 class="cause-subtitle">Occupational segregation (concentration in certain jobs)</h3>
        <p class="cause-text">
            Men and women often cluster into different industries and roles. For example, women are more
            likely to work in lower-paying fields such as caregiving, education, or administrative support,
            while men are more concentrated in higher-paying fields like technology and engineering.
            According to the International Labour Organization, nearly 60% of women worldwide are employed in
            just three sectors — health, education, and social work. On the other hand, men are overrepresented in
            dangerous but higher-paying jobs (like construction or mining), which can also contribute to inequality.
        </p>

        <h3 class="cause-subtitle">Discrimination and unconscious bias in promotions and hiring</h3>
        <p class="cause-text">
            Bias affects both genders. For example, women may face stereotypes about being “less committed”
            due to family responsibilities, while men can face bias when applying for roles in nursing, teaching,
            or caregiving. On average, women worldwide earn about 77 cents for every dollar earned by men (UN Women, 2022),
            but studies also show that men entering female-dominated professions may be undervalued or face stigma.
        </p>

        <h3 class="cause-subtitle">Limited access to leadership positions (“glass ceiling”)</h3>
        <p class="cause-text">
            High-paying leadership roles often show imbalance. As of 2023, women hold only 32% of senior management
            roles globally (Grant Thornton report). At the same time, men can also face barriers in leadership within
            sectors traditionally dominated by women, such as healthcare administration or education management.
            These gaps limit overall equality across genders.
        </p>

        <h3 class="cause-subtitle">Career interruptions (family or caregiving responsibilities)</h3>
        <p class="cause-text">
            Career breaks affect both men and women, but in different ways. Women are more likely to take maternity
            leave, while men may face stigma when requesting paternity leave or flexible schedules. In the U.S.,
            42% of mothers report reducing work hours or taking career breaks for family responsibilities, compared
            to 28% of fathers (Pew Research Center). Both situations can slow career progression and reduce lifetime
            earnings, reinforcing inequality.

                    <p>
                        Gender inequality often leads to lower lifetime earnings. For example, women working in
                        lower-paying sectors or men facing stigma in caregiving roles may both experience reduced
                        wage growth. On average, the global gender pay gap still stands at about 20% (ILO, 2022),
                        affecting long-term financial security for individuals of all genders.

                    <p>
                        Inequality raises poverty risks, but in different ways. Single mothers and elderly women are
                        disproportionately affected due to lower lifetime earnings, while men in unstable or dangerous
                        low-paying jobs (like construction or mining) also face economic vulnerability. These dynamics
                        increase the risk of poverty across genders.

                        When skills are underutilized due to gender bias or segregation, economies suffer. The World
                        Bank estimates that closing gender gaps in work could boost global GDP by $160 trillion.
                        Inequality prevents men and women alike from fully contributing to national productivity.

                        Under representation in leadership roles affects both genders, though in different contexts.
                        Globally, women hold only 32% of senior management roles (Grant Thornton, 2023). Conversely,
                        men are underrepresented in leadership within female-dominated sectors such as healthcare and
                        education. Lack of balanced representation in decision-making reduces diverse perspectives
                        and fair policy outcomes.

        <h3 class="cause-subtitle">Pay disparities across races</h3>
        <p class="cause-text">
            People of color, regardless of gender, are often underpaid compared to their white counterparts.
            For example, studies in the U.S. show that Black and Hispanic workers consistently earn less than
            white workers, even when education and experience are the same.

        <h3 class="cause-subtitle">Fewer promotion and leadership opportunities</h3>
        <p class="cause-text">
            Racial minorities face reduced chances of advancing into management or executive positions.
            This “glass ceiling” affects both men and women of color, keeping leadership roles less diverse
            and limiting career growth.

        <h3 class="cause-subtitle">Workplace discrimination and mental health</h3>
        <p class="cause-text">
            Bias, stereotyping, and microaggressions create hostile environments for minority employees.

        <h3 class="cause-subtitle">Loss of diverse perspectives</h3>

            When leadership lacks racial and cultural diversity, organizations miss out on fresh ideas and innovation.
