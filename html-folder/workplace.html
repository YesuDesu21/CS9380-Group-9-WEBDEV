            How Gender and Race Shape the Workplace</p>

        <p>Behind the promise of fairness, deep divides in pay and <br>
            treatment still shape careers depending on gender and race.</p>

        <p>Gender Pay Gap: Equal Work, Unequal Pay</p> <!--make first section bold-->
        <p>The gender pay gap is the average difference in earnings between men and women in the <br>
            workforce. It reflects not just differences in pay for the same job, but also unequal access to <br>
            higher-paying roles, promotions, and career opportunities, often driven by discrimination, <br>
            occupational segregation, and social expectations.</p>

        <p>Race Differences: Equal Worth, Unequal Treatment</p> <!--make first section bold-->
        <p>Race differences in the workplace describe how cultural norms, stereotypes, and systemic <br>
            biases affect how employees of different racial or ethnic backgrounds are valued and treated. <br>
            These differences intersect with gender, meaning women of certain racial groups often face a <br>
            “double disadvantage”.</p>

        <!--insert medias per example with descriptions below -->

        <!--key highlight. Give special UI-->
        <p>Race and gender biases intersect to create complex <br>
            inequalities, where women of marginalized groups face both <br>
            sexism and racism in professional environments.</p>
