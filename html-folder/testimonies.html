Gender equality will benefit the family because women are the centre of the family and play the most important role in the future of the family, community, and nation.”</p>

                <p>“I started my career 16 years ago, although I had some great achievements. There were always some ‘banana peels’ in the way. Small, sometimes hard-to-spot biases were constantly there. Making me question my worth and feel confused, distressed, drained, and sometimes insomniac. I’ve been told not to go to the meeting. because there were already ‘too many people in the room.’ Then I was told to go to ‘beautify’ the room. I was told I should go to the meeting but stay quiet. I’ve been denied. I want to submit my project for an industry award and move away from a beer account. I was the only female and foreigner because there was no ‘cultural fit’. I had to ‘reinvent the industry’. At the same time, male peers were getting promoted just by doing their jobs. All these stories show that there is still much to fight for.”</p>

He insisted I’d have to stay on the lower training wage until I’d proven myself.” She filed a formal complaint, and as a result, the company apologized, committed to equal-opportunity training, and ensured she received appropriate pay.</p>

                These voices illustrate the personal struggles that statistics cannot fully capture.
                They show that inequality manifests differently across cultures, professions, and identities —
                but the common thread is that it limits human dignity and opportunity.
