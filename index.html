    <h1 class="intro-title">GENDER EQUALITY</h1>

    <div class="intro-left">
        <p>
        The goal of gender equality is to guarantee that all people, regardless of gender, have the same rights and opportunities.  
        It places a strong emphasis on taking down obstacles that stand in the way of people realising their greatest potential.  
        Due to disparate social, cultural, and political structures, prejudice against women and gender minorities has existed for a long time.  
        Legal changes as well as cultural changes that dispel prejudices and antiquated ideas are necessary to achieve real equality.
        </p>
        <p>
        <br>Promoting gender equality is advantageous to society at large.  Equal access to healthcare, education, employment, and politics fosters diversity, creativity, and prosperity in communities.  
        By enabling everyone to reach their greatest potential, it also promotes economic progress.  Gender biases must be addressed and eradicated in order to create a setting where everyone may prosper.

        <h1>STEREOTYPES</h1>
    <div id="stereotype-overview">
        <p>
        Gender stereotype represents a widely held belief regarding the attributes, characteristics, or roles typically associated with women and men. 
        These stereotypes can have negative effects when they restrict individuals from fully developing their personal skills, advancing in their careers, or making independent choices in their lives.

    <div class="card">
        <div class="face face1">
        <p>The stereotype that women who do not dress or behave “modestly” are inviting sexual violence is a harmful form of victim-blaming.
        It wrongly shifts responsibility from the perpetrator to the victim, leading to silenced survivors and denied justice. 
        In reality, what a woman wears or how she behaves does not determine her right to safety. Consent is never defined by clothing.</p>

        <div class="face face2">
            <p>Women who do not dress or behave “modestly” are assumed to have consented to sexual acts </p>

    </div>

    <div class="card">
        <div class="face face1">
        <p>The stereotype that women are natural nurturers while men are natural leaders reinforces traditional gender roles that limit individual potential.
            It positions women primarily in caregiving and domestic roles, while assuming men are inherently suited for authority, decision-making, and power.
            This bias not only restricts opportunities for women in leadership but also discourages men from pursuing nurturing professions such as teaching or caregiving.</p>

        <div class="face face2">
            <p>Women are natural nurturers; men are natural leaders</p>

    <div class="card">
        <div class="face face1">
        <p> The stereotype that being transgender or gender non-conforming is “profoundly wrong” stems from rigid beliefs that only two fixed genders exist and that they must align with one’s biological sex. 
            This harmful notion invalidates the identities and lived experiences of transgender and gender-diverse individuals, often leading to discrimination, stigma, and social exclusion. 
            Such a stereotype undermines human dignity and denies people the right to express their authentic selves.

    <p>
    Gender stereotypes place unfair limits on people’s lives by dictating how they should act or who they should be based solely on gender. 
    They can silence victims, deny opportunities, and invalidate the identities of those who do not fit into rigid expectations.
     These stereotypes are deeply rooted in culture and history, but they are created by people, and therefore, they can be changed by people.
